  @par Description

  This folder contains a standard EWSTM8 template workspace including all the 
  user-modifiable files that are necessary to create a new project.
  These project templates can be used by mean of minor updates in the library files
  to run theSTM8L10x_StdPeriph_Examples, or custom user applications.  

  
  @par Directories contents

 - project .ewd/.eww/.ewp: A pre-configured project file with the provided library 
                           structure that produces an executable image with IAR 
                           Embedded Workbench.


  @par How to use it ?

 - Open the Project.eww workspace.
     @note The needed define symbols for the project configurations are already 
           declared in the preprocessor section.

 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
  

@note
 - STM8L10x devices are STM8L microcontrollers with a Flash memory density up to 8 Kbytes.
