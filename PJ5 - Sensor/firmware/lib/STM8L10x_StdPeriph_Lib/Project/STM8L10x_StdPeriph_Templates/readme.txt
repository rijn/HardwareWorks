@par Project Example Template Description 

This example is used as a template that can be used as reference to build any new 
firmware development for all STM8L10x product devices using the STM8L10x
Standard Peripherals Library.


@par Directory contents 

This folder contains standard template projects for EWSTM8, STVD with Cosmic, 
STVD with raisonance and RIDE toolchains that compile the needed STM8L10x Standard
Peripheral's drivers plus all the user-modifiable files that are necessary to 
create a new project. 

  - Project/STM8L10x_StdPeriph_Templates/stm8l10x_conf.h    Library Configuration file

  - Project/STM8L10x_StdPeriph_Templates/stm8l10x_it.c:     Source file containing the interrupt handlers (the 
                                     function bodies are empty in this template).

  - Project/STM8L10x_StdPeriph_Templates/stm8l10x_it.h      Header file including all interrupt handlers prototypes.

  - Project/STM8L10x_StdPeriph_Templates/main.c             Main program

          
@note
 - STM8L10x devices are STM8L microcontrollers with a flash memory density up to 8 Kbytes.
