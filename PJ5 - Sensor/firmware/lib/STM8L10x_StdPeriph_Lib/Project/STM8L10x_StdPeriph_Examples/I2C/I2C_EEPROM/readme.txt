  @par Example description

This firmware provides a basic example of how to use the I2C firmware library and
an associate I2C EEPROM driver to communicate with an I2C EEPROM device (here the
example is interfacing with M24C64 EEPROM)

I2C peripheral is configured in Master transmitter during write operation and in
Master receiver during read operation from I2C EEPROM. 

The speed is set to 200kHz and can be configured by modifying the related define
in stm8l_eval_i2c_ee.h file.

For M24C64 devices all the memory is accessible through the two-bytes 
addressing mode and need to define block addresses. In this case, only the physical 
address has to be defined (according to the address pins (E0,E1 and E2) connection).
This address is defined in stm8l_eval_i2c_ee.h (default is 0xA0: E0, E1 and E2 
tied to ground). 
The EEPROM addresses where the program start the write and the read operations 
is defined in the main.c file. 

First, the content of Tx1_Buffer is written to the EEPROM_WriteAddress1 and the
written data is read. The written and the read buffers data are then compared.
Following the read operation, the program waits that the EEPROM reverts to its 
Standby state. A second write operation is, then, performed and this time, Tx2_Buffer
is written to EEPROM_WriteAddress2, which represents the address just after the last 
written one in the first write. After completion of the second write operation, the 
written data is read. The contents of the written and the read buffers are compared.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8L10x devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L101-EVAL evaluation
    board and can be easily tailored to any other development board.
    
  - STM8L1x-EVAL Set-up
     - This example uses the I2C EEPROM already available on STM8L1x-EVAL board.
     - Before Running the example make sure that JP8 is fitted.

  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L10x_StdPeriph_Templates
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required file:
    - stm8l_eval_i2c_ee.c  (under Utilities\STM8L101_EVAL\Common)  
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - The test will compare the sent buffer & received buffer data.

  
@note
 - STM8L10x devices are STM8L microcontrollers with a Flash memory density up to 8 Kbytes.
