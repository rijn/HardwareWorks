  @par Example description

  This example shows how to retarget the C library printf function to the USART. 
  This implementation output the printf message on the Hyperterminal using USART.

  The USART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Receive and transmit enabled
 

  @par Directory content

  - USART\USART_Printf\main.c                    Main file containing the "main" function
  - USART\USART_Printf\stm8l10x_conf.h           Library Configuration file
  - USART\USART_Printf\stm8l10x_it.c             Interrupt routines source (not used in this example)
  - USART\USART_Printf\stm8l10x_it.h             Interrupt routines declaration


   @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8L10x devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L101-EVAL evaluation
    board and can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - STM8L1x-EVAL Set-up
     - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
       CN8 and PC serial port.  

     - Hyperterminal configuration:
       - Word Length = 8 Bits
       - One Stop Bit
       - No parity
       - BaudRate = 115200 baud
       - flow control: None 


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L10x_StdPeriph_Templates
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  
@note
 - STM8L10x devices are STM8L microcontrollers with a Flash memory density up to 8 Kbytes.
