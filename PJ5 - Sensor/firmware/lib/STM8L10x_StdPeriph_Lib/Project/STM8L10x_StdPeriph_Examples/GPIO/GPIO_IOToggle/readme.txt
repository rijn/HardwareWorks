  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the GPIO peripheral to
  toggle Ports Pins infinitely.


  @par Directory content

  - GPIO\GPIO_IOToggle\main.c                   Main file containing the "main" function
  - GPIO\GPIO_IOToggle\stm8l10x_conf.h          Library Configuration file
  - GPIO\GPIO_IOToggle\stm8l10x_it.c            Interrupt routines source (not used in this example)
  - GPIO\GPIO_IOToggle\stm8l10x_it.h            Interrupt routines declaration


  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8L10x devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L101-EVAL evaluation
    board and can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - STM8L1x-EVAL Set-up
     - Three leds LD2, LD3 and LD4.

     
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L10x_StdPeriph_Templates
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example  
 
@note
 - STM8L10x devices are STM8L microcontrollers with a Flash memory density up to 8 Kbytes.
