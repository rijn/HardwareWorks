  @par Example description

  This example shows how to configure the TIM2 peripheral to generate two different 
  signals with two different delays.

  The TIM2CLK frequency is set to 2 MHz, the Prescaler is set to 128 and used in 
  Output Compare Active Mode.
 
  TIM2 counter clock = TIM2CLK / (Prescaler) = 15625 Hz 

  The TIM2 CCR1 register value is equal to 15625:
  TIM2_CH1 delay = CCR1_Val/TIM2 counter clock  = 1000 ms
  so the TIM2 Channel 1 generates a signal with a delay equal to 1000 ms.

  The TIM2 CCR2 register value is equal to 7812:
  TIM2_CH2 delay = CCR2_Val/TIM2 counter clock = 500 ms
  so the TIM2 Channel 2 generates a signal with a delay equal to 500 ms.
  
  The delay corresponds to the time difference between PC.6 and TIM2_CHx signal rising edges

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8L10x devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L101-EVAL evaluation
    board and can be easily tailored to any other development board.
    
  - STM8L1x-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope:
      - PC.6
      - TIM2_CH1  pin (PB.0)  
      - TIM2_CH2  pin (PB.2)  


  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L10x_StdPeriph_Templates
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Connect the TIM2 pins and PC.6 pin to an oscilloscope 
  

@note
 - STM8L10x devices are STM8L microcontrollers with a Flash memory density up to 8 Kbytes.
