  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the SPI peripheral 
  in order to communicate with a monochrome LCD peripheral like the one present 
  on the eval-board.

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8L10x devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L101-EVAL evaluation
    board and can be easily tailored to any other development board.
    
  - STM8L1x-EVAL Set-up
     - Three leds LD2, LD3 and LD4 
     - Key push button.
     - LCD Display
 
  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L10x_StdPeriph_Templates
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - A welcome message should be displayed on the LCD
  - Press the Key button in order to change the message on the LCD and the LED2,
    LED3 and LED4 states.
  
@note
 - STM8L10x devices are STM8L microcontrollers with a Flash memory density up to 8 Kbytes.
