  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to make a communication 
  (Write & Read data) between the SPI and a MicroSD memory card like the one 
  present on the evalboard.
	
  First, Fill the Tx_Buffer with data to be written into the MicroSD memory 
  followed by a read of that data.
  Then data read from the MicroSD memory stored in the Rx_Buffer are compared
  with the expected values of the Tx_Buffer. The result of this comparison is 
  stored in the "TransferStatus" variable.

 @par Directory contents

  - SPI\SPI_MSD\main.c                       Main file containing the "main" function
  - SPI\SPI_MSD\stm8l10x_conf.h              Library Configuration file
  - SPI\SPI_MSD\stm8l10x_it.c                Interrupt routines source 
  - SPI\SPI_MSD\stm8l10x_it.h                Interrupt routines declaration
  

  @par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM8L10x devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM8L101-EVAL evaluation
    board and can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - STM8L1 Set-up
     - Plug a MicroSD memory card into the dedicated connector (CN1).
     - LCD display.
     - Key button.
     

  @par How to use it ?

  In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

  - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
    Project\STM8L10x_StdPeriph_Templates
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Add the required files:
    - stm8l_eval_spi_sd.c (under Utilities/STM8L101_EVAL/Common)
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)
  - The LCD displays " SPI example SPI & MicroSD Communication"
  - Insert MicroSD memory then validate by pressing Key button
  - If the read data from the MicroSD memory are the same as the written ones
    the LCD displays "W&R block Success" otherwise "W&R block Error".
@note
 - STM8L10x devices are STM8L microcontrollers with a Flash memory density up to 8 Kbytes.
